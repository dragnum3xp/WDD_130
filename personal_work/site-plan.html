        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        All people starting their own business, will find out soon or later that the internet is a powerful resource to approach their products to possible costumers. With this site I will offer them to make their own easy, enjoyable and efficient websites. I also will offer other services as: Designing data bases and creating ads in google for other pages. I want to provide them good information about why they need a good a website, the impact in their sales over the time and show that they don’t need to learn all the things for just creating a website for themselves, instead they could use my services, and how this would be a good and efficient way to get their own. For accomplish this I will search for studies who show the impacts of web sites in the growing of a business and show results for them. I want the site to be easy to navigate and readable so I will choose a good text size even if the page needs more height for that.  </p> 
        
      <p> 
        <b>Visitors will come with the question:</b> "How much it's cost" and my idea is, presenting them with engaging content on the page and encouraging to make contact with me for more information, they will be more willing to hire the service the more confident they become, I will not show prices in this Project because I do not know for sure how Much would cost and this is practice, so I will be focusing only in creating an engaging content to get their attention.
      </p>  
      <p> 
        <b>The strategy of the site</b> is all about marketing, getting attention and make them feel at least more curious about the service, so with good information and well looking page I want to make them feel secure about going to me for their needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the purpose of the site is making them try to   contact me, I will give some buttons of “contact me” through the page, after every block of information  for being more precisely. I want to show the content   in columns and boxes to make easy to read and   understand. I want the first page to show them about  what can be done for them.

        I will use phrases as: “The best way to jump to a next level”, “Increase your sales as never before!”, “Make more with less”. I will also share few personal thoughts and/or quotes from famous people related to the area of technology to motivate them more. In the footer of every page will be my name(or name of the company), the year, the Instagram page, Facebook page, and WhatsApp contact.

      <h3>[FAQ]</h3>
      <p>
        On this page, I want to answer the common questions the visitors probably would ask themselves and me, like: How long is the time of the service, if there's a guarantee, if they can make decisions on the design of the page, how can a good website improve their business.
        And the way I will answer the questions is providing information along side the answer and try to pass confidence saying that the questions are worth to ask and making contact with me would aloud them to ask other questions they do not find in this page. I also want to use images that demonstrate people thinking as a form of make them feel normal and common to have doubts about the service.

      <h3>[Contact Us]</h3>
      <p>
        On this page I will provide ways and links for getting more information and negotiation. I will provide them with an Email address, Phone Number, Location, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and will give a final quote for encouragement below the contact information.
