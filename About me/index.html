    <h2>Phillips Wallita</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am great lover of all virtual tecnologies, my name is Filipe like you saw above.</p>
    <p>Growing in the Church gave me a great understand 
    about how the tecnologies of our era can lead us more close to God,
    help our fellow beings and improve the way we live. One 
    thing i would like to share with every living person is that God
    wants us to get knowledge, the most we can in this life, 
    because will be useful even outside of this mortal existence.
    </p>
    <p>My favorite hobbie as a kid and a tennager was playing video games, 
    so i think it's the core of my interest on tecnologies, 
    and they teach me a lot of myself. I also like music, so i learned 
    how to play ukulele and i love the song of it. Last but more important 
    than the others are my love for learning about history. I can easily lost 
    myself in the world of mitology, wars, beliefs and the life of ancient people,
    and this for sure taught me more than any other thing. I enjoy combining this 
    three hobbies together, Playing a game setted on a especific 
    historical time and enjoying sounds and soundtracks that fits the ambient. 
    </p>
    <p>I did Served a mission in Brazil, and was my best life experience and i really got 
    a strong testimony of Jesus Chris, feel his Spirit being with me, 
    and help him even a little to build his kingdom on earth.
    I'm Actually pursuing certification to be a software developer and i'm feeling grateful 
    to this opportunity to study at BYU-Idaho.</p>
    <p>Lets enjoy this time, and learn everything we can in order to achieve our goals, 
    and i will be happy to help everyone who ask me. </p>
